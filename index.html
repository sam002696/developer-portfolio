            <p>Spider-Man has spider-like abilities including superhuman strength and the ability to cling to most
                surfaces.
                He is also extremely agile and has amazing reflexes. Spider-Man also has a “spider sense,” that warns
                him of
                impending danger. Spider-Man has supplemented his powers with technology.</p>
